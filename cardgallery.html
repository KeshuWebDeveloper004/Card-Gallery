<h1> LION </h1>     
 <p>Lions are highly territorial and occupy the same area for generations. Females actively defend their territories against other females, while resident males protect prides from rival coalitions. Territory size depends on prey abundance, as well as access to water and denning sites.</p>

<h1> LEOPARD </h1>
<P> Leopards are solitary creatures that only spend time with others when they are mating or raising young. They are also nocturnal and spend their nights hunting instead of sleeping.

<h1> JAGUAR </h1>
<P>An apex predator (no natural enemies), jaguar survival is threatened only when humans intentionally kill them or decrease their ability to feed by destroying or encroaching on their habitat. In some areas, their fear of humans has decreased due to ecotourism and intentional feeding.<P>

<h1> CARACAL </h1>
<P>Like most wild cats, caracals are primarily solitary and territorial animals. However, they may form pairs for the duration of mating or small mother-offspring groups during rearing of young. Adult males hold territories which they patrol widely, mark with urine and scats, and defend against other adult males.<P>

<h1> BOBCAT </h1>
<P>Perhaps you have seen a bobcat in your neighborhood. Rest assured, bobcats do not attack people. In fact, bobcat attacks are virtually unknown; however, no one should ever attempt to touch or handle a wild bobcat or her kittens. Bobcats weigh between 15-40 pounds, which makes them small-to-medium sized carnivores.<P>
